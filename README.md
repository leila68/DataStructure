# DataStructures
This is the set of data structures that are written in C#. The list of data structures are: <br>
1. Array
2. Queue
3. Stack
4. Linked list
5. Doubly linked list

They don't have any dependency and they should be run independently. You only need a C# compiler like the visual studio to run these codes. Each of them contain implementation of basic operations. <br>
1. Array(sort)
2. Queue(insert, delete, check empty)
3. Stack (push, pop, check empty, check full)
4. Linked list (add first, add last, delete, reverse)
5. Doubly linked list(add first, add last, search delete, reverse)
